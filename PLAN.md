# PLAN.md - Updated Implementation Plan

## Current Status: 90% Complete ✅

**The goal of this application is to keep the existing functionality and extend it.**

- ✅ **Current functionality:** Every N seconds, the application queries data from the SEDA network and tracks the results. This part is working and preserved.
- ✅ **New functionality added:** After results are tracked from SEDA, these results are pushed to EVM chains (Base, and other L2s). The EVM result pushing logic is implemented.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Core SEDA polling/tracking logic: **COMPLETE**
- ✅ EVM integration framework: **COMPLETE** 
- ✅ Configuration system: **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Testing infrastructure: **COMPLETE**
- ⚠️ Code cleanup and optimization: **IN PROGRESS**
- ⚠️ Final integration testing: **PENDING**

## Remaining Tasks to Complete

### 1. **Code Cleanup and Optimization** (Priority: HIGH)

#### 1.1. Replace Debug Logs with Proper Logging
- **Issue**: Extensive `console.log` usage throughout codebase instead of structured logging
- **Action Required**: 
  - Replace all `console.log` calls with proper logger calls using the existing `LoggingService`
  - Keep only essential user-facing logs for configuration summary and critical status updates
  - Remove debug logs from production code paths
- **Files to Update**:
  - `src/evm-networks/evm-contract-interactor.ts` (20+ debug logs)
  - `src/evm-networks/evm-result-poster.ts` (6 debug logs)
  - `src/core/scheduler/statistics.ts` (status logs are appropriate)
  - `config.ts` (configuration logs are appropriate)
- **After this step**: Run the application and verify logging is clean and professional

#### 1.2. Resolve Remaining TODOs
- **Issue**: 3 TODO items remain in `simple-solver/` directory
- **Action Required**:
  - Implement network configuration logic in `simple-solver/src/simple-solver.ts:296`
  - Complete network interface implementation in `simple-solver/src/simple-solver.ts:346`
  - Address nonce management in `simple-solver/src/networks/evm/evm-network.ts:22`
- **After this step**: Ensure no TODO comments remain in the codebase

#### 1.3. Integration of Parallel Implementations
- **Issue**: `simple-solver/` and `evm-abi/` directories exist as parallel implementations
- **Action Required**:
  - Evaluate if `simple-solver/` should be merged into main implementation or removed
  - Integrate `evm-abi/` into the main codebase if needed for ABI management
  - Ensure no duplication between implementations
- **After this step**: Single, coherent implementation without redundant code

---

### 2. **Final Integration Testing** (Priority: HIGH)

#### 2.1. End-to-End Testing
- **Action Required**:
  - Test complete flow: SEDA DataRequest → Result retrieval → EVM posting
  - Verify all EVM networks configured in `config.ts` work correctly
  - Test retry logic and error handling under various failure scenarios
  - Validate profitability calculations work as expected
- **Test scenarios**:
  - Normal operation with successful SEDA results
  - EVM network failures and retry behavior
  - Configuration validation and startup checks
  - Graceful shutdown and cleanup
- **After this step**: Document test results and any issues found

#### 2.2. Performance and Reliability Testing
- **Action Required**:
  - Test extended operation (multiple hours) to verify stability
  - Monitor memory usage and potential leaks
  - Verify proper cleanup of completed DataRequests
  - Test behavior under high load or rapid result generation
- **After this step**: Confirm application is production-ready

---

### 3. **Documentation Finalization** (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 3.1. Update README with Current Architecture
- **Action Required**:
  - Update architecture section to reflect EVM integration
  - Add section on EVM network configuration
  - Include troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Add performance tuning recommendations
- **After this step**: README accurately reflects current implementation

#### 3.2. Environment Configuration Documentation
- **Action Required**:
  - Update `env.example` with all current variables
  - Add validation for all required EVM network variables
  - Document gas optimization strategies for different EVM chains
- **After this step**: Complete deployment documentation available

---

### 4. **Production Readiness** (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 4.1. Security Review
- **Action Required**:
  - Ensure no private keys or sensitive data in logs
  - Validate all environment variable handling
  - Review error messages for information disclosure
- **After this step**: Application ready for production deployment

#### 4.2. Monitoring and Observability
- **Action Required**:
  - Ensure all critical operations are properly logged
  - Add health check endpoints if needed
  - Verify statistics and metrics are comprehensive
- **After this step**: Application provides adequate operational visibility
